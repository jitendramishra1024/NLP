PROJECT -01 

CONSUMER COMPLAINT CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING 

TEXT PRE PROCESSING : LOWER, REMOVED STOP WORD , PUNCTUATION , LEMMATIZATION 

VECTORIZATION :TFIDF 

MODEL SELECTION : AMONG LOGISTIC , RANDOM FOREST ,SVM , MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES 

TRIED USING BOTH NLTK AND SPACY 

APPROACH 1 :Directly use text as it is with out text preprocessing in TFIDF then use vector in machine learning
 
APPROACH 2 :Text preprocessing using NLTK then TF IDF then machine learning 

APPROACH 3 :Text preprocessing using Spacy then use TFIDF then machine learning 




PROJECT -02:

FAKENEWS CLASSIFIER USING LSTM 

PROJECT 03:

WORD2 VEC PRETRAINED INTRODUCTION 


PROJECT 04:

HAPPY MOMENT CLASSIFIER USING PRETRAINED WORD2VEC
